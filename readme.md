### msc tools scripts

these are some scripts where it might be useful for developers to hack around with the protocol

```
deobfus.py deobfuscates MSC packets for debugging
generateTX* generates the appropriate transaction from the cmd line given input from JSON
getbalance gets balances of MSC addresses
geConsensus calculates consesnsus
redeemMultisig redeems dust or multisig (1 of n) outs automatically (if you're a msc dev, very useful)
```

licence is similar to m$ model: 
please pay me royalties upwards of 10000x the profits of any software this code is used in
if you do not i will send you an angry letter
if you still do not pay i will send a harsh verbal communication
and etc. further escalation until i am paid or the universe implodes

jk, do-whatever-you-want & please send PRs if you see something wrong/off/incorrect.
